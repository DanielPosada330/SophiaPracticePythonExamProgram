# SophiaPracticePythonExamProgram
I am following along with Sophia Learning's Intro to Python course. I am practicing writing programs in Python.
In this specific program, I am practicing if and else statements, alongside concatenating the "print()" and "input()" functions.
Ex: score = int(input("What is your exam score? (0-100): "))
